Functionality
1. Admin Dashboard
View, add, update, and delete products.
Manage users and assign roles.
Access advanced analytics (future scope).


2. User Dashboard
Browse available products or services.
View detailed product information.
Interact with features like searching and filtering (future scope).

3. Product Management
Products can be dynamically created, updated, or removed by Admins.
Product details include name, price, and description.


4. Role-Based Access
Admin: Full access to manage all resources (e.g., products and users).
User: Restricted access to general functionalities only.

5. Routing
Seamless navigation between pages using React Router.
Protected routes to ensure only authorized users access specific pages.

6. MySQL Database Integration
Persistent storage for products and user information.
Secure and efficient data retrieval.

7. API Integration
Fetch product and user data from the backend.
Perform CRUD operations for products via RESTful API.

8. Responsive Design
User-friendly interface optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

9. Error Handling
Displays appropriate error messages for failed actions or API calls.
Retry functionality for critical operations.

10. Future Enhancements (Planned)
User authentication and session management using JWT.
Advanced search, filter, and recommendation systems.
Dashboard analytics for admin users.

Debugging Common Issues
Frontend
1.	"Sample Product - $10.00" Appears Everywhere:
  o	Check the Product.jsx file for proper conditional rendering logic.
  o	Verify routes in Routing.js to ensure the AdminDashboard component is only accessible in the Admin route.
2.	API Call Failing:
  o	Check the .env file to ensure the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL is correct.
  o	Verify that the backend server is running on http://localhost:5000.
Backend
1.	Database Connection Errors:
  o	Ensure the .env file contains correct MySQL credentials.
  o	Verify that the MySQL server is running.
2.	Authorization Errors:
  o	Check the auth.js middleware for proper role-based access implementation.
  o	Ensure JWT token generation and validation are functioning correctly.
________________________________________
Future Improvements
•	Frontend:
  o	Add authentication and role-based access using JWT.
  o	Improve UI/UX with advanced styling and animations.
•	Backend:
  o	Implement robust validation for API endpoints.
  o	Add testing using tools like Mocha or Jest.
•	Database:
  o	Optimize queries for better performance.
  o	Add indexing for frequently queried columns.
